## Description

Pet home was created with one goal in mind: Making tamable mobs in Minecraft not only useful and engaging, but to promote the taming of mobs as a playstyle by giving massive improvements to how tame mobs behave and interact with the world. Not only have we expanded the amount of mobs in vanilla Minecraft that can be tamed, but we have also fixed several problems with these mobs, added new items and blocks to improve the tamed mob experience, and have introduced a new Pet Enchanting system. Most of these changes should be reflected in both mobs from vanilla and new tamed mobs introduced in other mods.

With this mod installed, no more will your pets have to sit out battles, exploration and more at home. Now they can join the fun without worry of permanently loosing them, or them being completely outclassed by other mobs and mods.
